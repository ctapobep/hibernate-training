In Hibernate all the entities can be in several states:
* Transient - the one that's not managed by Hibernate yet. E.g. you've just created an object `new Book()` - it's
 transient until you save it
* Attached - those that are attached to the Hibernate's Unit of Word (Session). In other words - those entities that
 were just saved, or those that were loaded from DB via Hibernate's Sesssion. These objects are attached unless session
 is closed or those objects were evicted from Session.
* Detached - those objects that were loaded by Hibernate, but then Session was closed or they were evicted. Note, that
 you can't rely on Hibernate's mechanisms when object is detached, nothing like lazy loading would work in this case.
 But you can attach entity back by saving or merging it.
