MyBatis provides us with a way to elliminate boilerplate code and instead we just create an 'sql to class' mapping.
It's phylosophy is to *map sql statements to classes and give flexibility to write SQL statements*. It's an SQL
mapper, it's not a full-blown ORM.

####How it works:

* There are XML files with SQL (these can actually be annotations, but they are less flexible) like `Book.mybatis.xml`
* XML files define namespaces (package + interface name) and operations like get/update/insert and any other you'd
 like to be there. Each operation should be named according to the interface defined in the namespace of XML file.
* Each result of operation is represented as <resultMap> which shows how to map SQL results to entities
* You can defined associations of the entity and MyBatis will execute additional SQL statements to load associations
* Even though Mappers are good, but they can't do much logic, thus we still define our DAO layer (even though it
implements same operations as Mappers).

####Problems MyBatis solves:
* Loading associations
* Cache. MyBatis can be configured to cache results
* Exception handling is the same as Spring Jdbc has because Spring has integration with MyBatis
* We need to write much less code

####Problems MyBatis has:
* Cascades still have to be handled manually
* No dirty checks
* Associations are not fully handled. E.g. you're loading Book with Author. MyBatis won't set Book for all authors
 even thought it's already loaded.
