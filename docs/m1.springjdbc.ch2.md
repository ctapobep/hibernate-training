We've already seen how Spring Jdbc solves our problems like exception handling and result set mapping,
but Spring Jdbc has its own problems:

* We still have to manually cascade associations, this may or may not be a big deal
* We have to programatically care about constraints, like not-null
* At DAO level somehow we need to figure out whether we need to select associations or not. How? We can use different
 methods for different cases or use special objects like Request, but it's still our burden
* We don't have dirty checks thus we need to update all records irrespectively whether they were actually changed or
 not
* What if we didn't load some association, should we leave it null? What if we're saving loaded object and it sees
 `null`, how should it distinguish between cases where it's really a `null` or that association wasn't loaded?
